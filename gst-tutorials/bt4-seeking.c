In this tutorial, we ask the pipeline if seeking is allowed (some sources like
live streams do not allow) and if yes, once the clip has been running for 10
seconds (this is a requirement), we can skip to a different position using a seek.

In previous tutorials, once the pipeline was setup & running, our main function
just sat and waited to receive an ERROR or EOS through the bus. Here, we modify
this function to periodically wake up and query the pipeline for the stream
position, so we can print it on the screen. This is similar to a media player
updating the UI periodically.

For sake of similplicity, we use `playbin` as the only element.

We implemented the querying part alongwith message parsing. This is why:
  - Querying (whether seeking is possible for the stream, and if yes, in what
  range) can only be done when the pipeline is in PLAY or PAUSE state.
  - Finding the current state of pipeline is possible via the messages received
  from the pipelime.
  - So we parse the messages and derive the state and if we find state to be PLAY
  or PAUSE, we query ðŸ˜Ž.

         A lot of intricacies are hidden behind this function. Lets look the params:
          - GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH: It discards all data currently in the pipeline
            before doing the seek. It might pause a bit while the pipeline is
            refilled and the new data starts to show up but greatly increases the
            responsiveness of the app. If not provided, stale data might show up
            for a while until the new position appears at the end of pipeline.
          - GST_SEEK_FLAG_KEY_UNIT: With most encoded video streams, seeking to
            arbitrary positions is not possible but only to certain frames called:
            'Key Frames'. When this flag is used, the seek will move to the closest
            key frame and start producing data *straight away*. If not used, the
            pipeline will move (internally) to the closest key frame and data will
            be show ONLY when it reaches the requested position. The latter is
            more accurate but might take longer.
          - GST_SEEK_FLAG_ACCURATE: Some media clips do not provide enough indexing
            information, meaning that seeking to arbitrary positions is time
            consuming. In such cases, GStreamer usually estimates the position to
            seek to and usually works just fine. If more precision is needed, then
            we provide this flag, which may also be time-consuming.
          `30 * GST_SECOND` is the time we wish to seek to.
